I'm a Brazilian programer living in the UK working on and with books.

I'm one of the co-founders of [Canelo](https://www.canelo.co), a fast-growing independent publisher commited to modernising the publishing industry.

I'm not around on social media much anymore, but you can probably find me at [toot.cafe/@nickbarreto](https://toot.cafe/@nickbarreto).
